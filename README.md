### AI Augmentation

#### Examples

Throughout this project, I used ChatGPT as a support tool to guide me in writing and improving code. For example, I referred to AI assistance when learning how to correctly structure Bootstrap components and to better understand best practices, such as writing clear and professional README documentation.

AI was not used to build the entire project, but rather to:

-   Clarify and teach me coding concepts I was less familiar with (e.g., Bootstrap).
-   Guide me on best practices, such as writing a clear README.
-   Improve efficiency by quickly testing solutions instead of searching documentation manually.

This approach allowed me to stay focused on the project objectives, while using AI strategically to strengthen my skills and accelerate the development process.

#### Debugging

I also used ChatGPT to assist with debugging when I encountered issues in my code. For example, when trying out new concepts for the first time, I often wasn't sure why my code wasn't working. By pasting the code into ChatGPT, I was able to:

-   Identify errors more quickly.
-   Receive suggested corrections and explanations, which in turn helped me learn more.
-   Learn from the debugging process so I could avoid similar mistakes in the future.

This made debugging more efficient and helped me build a stronger understanding of any underlying issues.

#### Improving Performance and UX

AI was used to help optimise code for performance and user experience by:

-   Suggesting cleaner and more efficient code structures.
-   Recommending accessibility and readability improvements.
-   Supporting best practices that contributed to a Lighthouse score of above 97% and passing validation checks.

#### AI's Role in Development

AI tools, such as ChatGPT, supported multiple aspects of the development process, from clarifying coding concepts to debugging and optimising performance.

The use of AI improved efficiency, reduced time spent troubleshooting, and enhanced understanding of best practices, ultimately contributing to cleaner code, better UX, and faster project completion.
